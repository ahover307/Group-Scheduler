for css use Materialize CSS library - or be better at css than i am and make it look good.

for firebase the template thing. The info we need is

party kids name
parents name
email
phone number
party kids birthday   ( i forgot this in the form)
party package using the ints i defined somewhere else.
    for example, a basic is a 1, single is a 2, double is a 3
party area, start and end time for each area. Nice thing about this type of database is it shouldnt matter if those are different fields in the same table
party start and end times in total

anything i forgot?
